### Ciao a tutti! (or Hi there) ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Physics PhD student at Harvard, doing research in particle physics. Together with Prof. Roxanne Guenette, I am investigating the possible existence of sterile neutrinos using data collected by the MicroBooNE experiment. I tackle similar questions from a theoretical perspective with Prof. Carlos Arguelles, while developing new tools and analysis techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning theory and intersections with neuroscience...and more statistics, always more statistics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects and startups with technical knowledge at the core.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with bridging gaps between physical science and newer statistical techniques.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to do statistical analysis correctly, but also about curioisities about physics and particles!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nicolofoppiani@g.harvard.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- :round_pushpin: Currently based in Cambridge (MA), but looking forward to travelling again soon!
- âš¡ Fun fact: During high school my latin professor recommended Law School for my future...Would I have discovered GitHub had I followed the advice?
